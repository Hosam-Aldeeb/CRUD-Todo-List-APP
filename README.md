# CRUD-Todo-List APP
A Simple CRUD app that displays full-stack principles through a to-do list.



## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, Express.js, EJS


## Optimizations
The UI could be improved with more time spent on styling, however, the intent of this project was to demonstrate CRUD principles for the purpose of learning!

## Lessons Learned:
Using EJS is very useful when it comes to rendering dnyamic pages! React.js Could have also been utilized, however, given the small size of the project, EJS was a better option! 
Express.js really does simplify the back-end server set up!
